Generally Apple = Nice-ish 

But I think they forgot to do some folder management ( 	I'm talking about the DCIM folder ).

:)


How to use ??

0) Make sure you've python installed !!!
1) Copy DCIM folder to your local machine 
2) Inside DCIM folder,you must be having `100APPLE` folder. Copy these two scripts and paste them inside DCIM folder in parallel to `100APPLE` folder.
3) If you want to do some clean-up of the folders, run `python folder_cleaner.py` script and it will do everything for you. Right from making the folders to moving them inside it.
4) Now if you don't like how I arranged the files, just run `python revert_everything_back_to_main_folder.py` script and it will revert back everything back to how it was.


Why did I created this script ?

1) Because I don't like all the content of a folder mixed up
2) Because I was feeling a bit bored
3) Mainly 2)


What python version did I use and why ?

I used Python 2.7.17 because 2.7 is still the most common version used. And if you're using Python 3, I guess you're smart enough to convert from Python 2.7 to Python 3.

P.S. This is how to check for your python version -
python --version
Python 2.7.17


Why use my script ?

Well, don't use it then. :) 


Can you use this script ?

Well, it depends - do you want to use it ? If yes, be my guest.
And if it made your life easy, drop me an email at dsklegend@live.com.
I'd be happy to know that someone out there is using my script xD.
